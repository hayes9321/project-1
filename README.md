#About Project:

This project is only available for web, and will not work on mobile devices.


This was the first project I built. The project uses Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the Phaser.io library technologies. The goal of this project was to build a game to better understand how programming works, and have something fun to show others. 


I only designed one level of the game. If I was to continue building this game I would incorporate more levels and create new challenges making each level harder and harder.
